How is time understood in Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America compared to the U.S.? 

Time in Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America is a loose thought. For example, most Americans will stick on that 9-5 schedule whereas it wouldn't be that case. It is more of enjoying the moment and the people that surround you.
